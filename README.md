## Computer Club

Is the official weblog of Computer Club. We wanted to not only host
but also encourage writing from our friends and loved ones. We welcome
posts from anybody!

## FAQ

**How can I contribute?**

* `git clone git@github.com:trello/computer-club`
* `cd computer-club`
* `bundle install --jobs 4`
* `./scripts/serve`
* `cp _drafts/{_example,your-title-here}.md`
* `$EDITOR _drafts/your-title-here.md`
* `git add !$`
* `git commit`
* `git push`

Once you're ready to publish, move your draft to `_posts` and prefix
with a date so that it sorts correctly.

Hao strongly encourage you to convert your Markdown to HTML: every
Markdown parser is different, and there's no guarantee that we're
going to stay on the same one forever.

Make sure to set up a person page too. See [people/](people/).

**Can we cross-post the writing to our own personal blogs, or even the Trello blog?**

Sure! Computer Club, like its physical instantiation, should be an
incubator and a safe space for ideas. Feel free to cross-post.
