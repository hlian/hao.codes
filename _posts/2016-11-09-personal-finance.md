Whereas perhaps most people treat personal finance as a chore, I find it as a fun hobby. Think of it as a video game except with bank passwords and HTML forms. 

One thing a lot of people in my friend group (yuppie programmer artist-dorks living in the United States) seem to struggle with is what to do with the sudden inflow of cash. I remember thatl. Something like $2,000 was showing up in my bank account every two weeks and, while I knew I was supposed to do _something_ with the money, I did not really know _what_.

So here are some basic things you can do with money that might help you, might not, depending on where you are in life and your possibly-examined privilege and a host of other factors. Like all advice, take it with a grain of salt; it is more for the benefit of the person giving the advice than the person receiving it.

## Pay off student-loan debts

Debts have the nasty habit of exponentially increasing and should generally be the primary goal of your personal finance at the outset. Most frequent kind of debt for people I know: student-loan debt. It seems those who have paid down their debts the fastest did it by renting out smaller apartments and avoiding luxury expenses. It sucks, and America does it wrong – no way to "lifehack" around this one, boys.

## Build credit

This is one of the most artificial aspects of personal finance: your credit score. [Credit Karma](https://creditkarma.com), sponsored by advertising, will let you see your credit score for free. More than anything else it is based on (1) your oldest credit-card account and (2) paying down your credit-card bills on time. So, as early as possible: 

* Apply for a credit card.

* Apply to the best one you can at your current credit score; try and find one with no annual fee and a decent rewards program.

* _Turn on autopay._ Late-payment fees are usually extraordinarily high. Credit-card companies are predatory mousetraps that profit off of two kinds of people: people who actually unable to pay off their credit cards, and those who simply forgot to turn on autopay.

* Set the autopay date to be near the date the rent comes out of your bank. This will make it easier to do math about your personal finances – it will be likely, for now anyway, that your two largests debits from your checking account will be your rent and your credit cards.

* Stick with Visa and MasterCard unless you already have a Visa/MasterCard card.

Whether you use your credit card or not is much less important than having one. My one advice is to _never give out your debit-card number_. With credit cards accounts, you can contest and cancel transactions. With checking accounts, once the money disappears it usually is gone. Banks typically have terrible customer support for people who are not billionaires and will be disinclined to help you. (Unfortunately, the one place where we still seem to need debit-card numbers is personal finance apps, like Square Cash or Venmo.)

## Use a password manager

It is 2016. Unless you can generate a _unique_ 16-character-long password for each website _and_ memorize all the safety questions, you are much better off investing in a password manager. I use Dashlane; it is about $7 a month I think.

And, safety questions: never use actual personal information as answers to safety questions. Generate a random password with your password manager (like `6VF3V5tMWedLZbKQB7`) and then append a digit for each security question. Like this:

* What was your mother's maiden name? `6VF3V5tMWedLZbKQB71`

* Why are we still using this antiquated barely-a-second-factor authentication system? `6VF3V5tMWedLZbKQB72`

* Are you feeling hopeful about America? `6VF3V5tMWedLZbKQB73`

You get it. Save this second random password, along with the questions, as an encrypted note in your password manager.

Turn on 2FA if your checking and credit account companies support it. Ideally point it at an email address you _never_ give out or a phone number.

## Open an individual retirement account

Using Vanguard (any brokerage that offer no-fee transactions on ETF/mutual-fund trades will do, but Vanguard has [in my personal experience] excellent phone support and extremely low expense ratios – look, there's going to be a lot of esoteric vocabulary so you will have to do some Googling – so Vanguard is the one I recommend), start a non-Roth IRA.

If your income is low enough you might quality for a Roth IRA. If so, do that. As of writing that limit is $116K for swinging bachelors.

What _is_ an IRA? Here is my mental model: an IRA is a bank account. It belongs to you and is your money but has special rules about withdrawals and deposits. You may deposit up to a certain amount into an IRA each year. Per the IRS, you may contribute up to $5,500 to IRAs each year – that is not $5,500 per IRA, that is $5,500 across all your IRAs. You can have more than one IRA. _You should absolutely contribute the maximum amount you can to IRAs each year._

Why: all transactions and earnings in an IRA have no tax impact. Once the money shows up in your IRA, you are free to trade at your brokerage without worrying about the capital-gains tax. Instead, you are taxed when you _withdraw_ from a non-Roth IRA, at your marginal income tax rate. If you withdraw before retirement age (59.5 as of writing), you are taxed an additional 10%. So don't do that.

Roth IRAs work similarly, except the marginal income tax is taken before you deposit. This is great because generally you expect to be in a higher income tax bracket when you retire in your 50s than when you start the account in your 20s.

Do _not_ worry about the Roth/non-Roth distinction. In the grand scheme of things it has little impact on your bottom line. It is more important that you have a retirement account. As soon as you can afford to set aside $5,500 (or so) per year make one! Invested money grows exponentially; tiny incremental increases in the compound interest percentage (e.g. ducking the capital-gains tax) will lead to big massive payoffs down the line.

## Contribute to your employer's 401(k), maybe

Your 401(k) is analogous to an IRA that your employer sets up. It replaces the older idea of a pension fund, which ... well, you can look that up on Wikipedia. So to reiterate: a 401(k) is an account you owe containing money that is yours, with which you can purchase stocks and bonds and whatnot. The sales are exempt from the capital-gains tax and everything is gravy except that you are heavily encouraged to wait until retirement to withdraw).

Some simple guidelines:

* If your employer matches up to $X amount, contribute at least $X amount. Matching is free money. There is no reason not to take advantage of it.

* Research _expenses_. Typically your 401(k) is managed by some shadowy financial group. They will take a cut each year for "operations" or some nonsense. This is _on top of_ the expense ratios built into the different stocks/bonds/funds you can buy – most 401(k)s give you a small menu of stocks/bonds/funds you can choose from.

* If you are fortunate enough to have a 401(k) with low expense ratios, e.g. your company's 401(k) program is managed by Vanguard, you should contribute more. Possibly as much as you are comfortable with. A good expense ratio is something less than 1%. Remember, minute differences in the expense ratio affect the exponential growth rate – leading to big differences down the line.

* As soon as your employment contract goes up, roll over your 401(k) into an IRA; if it is a Roth 401(k), you will have to roll it over into a Roth IRA. You can have multiple 401(k)s lying around, but it is a pain to keep tabs on all of them.

## Start a brokerage account

If after your IRA and your 401(k) you still have money lying around, put it into the American stock market. Keep it out of banks, keep it out of certificate deposits, keep it out of mass-money market accounts. You want to bet on America. Even though our economy goes through contractions, overall you will make money by investing in a blend of stocks and bonds.

This is not to say you will _beat_ the market; I have no advice for you there. This is to say that you will be able to align your money with the natural market growth America historically tends to experience. It far exceeds the usual interest rate that your savings account could offer. In fact, you should try and keep money out of a savings account altogether. A checking account provides easy access to quick cash and paying the security deposit on a new apartment; a brokerage account allows for the long-term accrual of wealth; a savings account (assuming a certain amount of privilege) is a weird Frankenstein's monster of both providing the worst of both worlds.

The general investment strategy, as exponentiated by Warren Buffet and numerous personal finance blogs and now this paragraph, is this: periodically put $X into a brokerage account; buy the same one or two index funds; hold. Why?

* Most people lack the knowledge to beat the market. As such you should avoid ever making specific bets on specific companies, no matter the allure. Specific bets are high risk; an index fund divides risk between some computer-and-human-chosen selection of stocks and bonds.

* The market will crash. The market will rebound. You will be unable to forecast either of the events in a short amount of time. You _will_ be able to rely on the historic growth of the market; any 25-year window on the S&P 500 shows growth. If you commit to the buy-and-hold strategy, you allow yourself to be released from worrying about short-term losses and gains.

* Vanguard is set up for this exact strategy. You can purchase the "Vanguard Target Retirement 2050" fund each time with $X. Over time Vanguard will decrease the amount of stocks (high-risk, young people) that fund holds and increase the amount of bonds (low-risk, old people).
