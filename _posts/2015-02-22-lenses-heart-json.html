title:  "Lenses and JSON are best friends in Haskell"
author: hao

<p>At Trello we’ve been playing with
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens">lenses</a>, from the world of
modern functional programming. Lenses are five stars but seem very
much like abstract foo-foo at first.</p>

<p>Thesis, which I will attempt to exponentiate without anything’s
resembling category theory or otherwise abstract foo-foo, which I love
and believe is critical for fighting entropy in large systems but [and I
agree] is pedagogically troublesome: <em>Lenses shine when dealing with
complicated data structures, like JSON</em>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&gt; import Control.Lens
&gt; import Data.Aeson
&gt; import Data.Aeson.Lens
&gt; import Data.Aeson.Types
&gt; import Data.Text

&gt; let json = replace "'" "\"" "{'user': {'boards': [{'title': 'hello, world', 'rating': 1.11111111111111111111111111111111111}]}}"

&gt; json ^? key "oops"
  Nothing

&gt; json ^? key "user"
  Just (Object (fromList [("boards",~snip~)]))

&gt; json ^? key "user" . key "boards" . nth 0 . key "title" . _String
  Just "hello, world"

&gt; let firstUserBoard = key "user" . key "boards" . nth 0

&gt; json ^? firstUserBoard . key "title" . _Number
  Nothing

&gt; let firstUserBoardRating = firstUserBoard . key "rating"

&gt; json ^? firstUserBoardRating . _Double
  Just 1.1111111111111112

&gt; json ^? firstUserBoardRating . _Number
  Just 1.11111111111111111111111111111111111

&gt; putStrLn . unpack $ json &amp; firstUserBoardRating . _Double %~ (fromIntegral . floor)
  {"user":{"boards":[{"rating":1,"date":"20150211","title":"hello, world"}]}}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Apologies for the long lines. And Trello doesn’t really let you rate
boards, but shush.</p>

<h2>Unpacking the example</h2>

<p>We use JSON all the time! So when we see something like lenses, our
eyes go wide. With very little code we have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Error handling. The <code>^?</code> operator ensures our program never crashes.
If at any point in our lens pipeline we cannot find the right key
into an object or the right index into an array, we will get a
<code>Nothing</code> back. And if the server incorrectly returns a string where
we expected a number, we will get a <code>Nothing</code> back. The downside is,
of course, that we have to unwrap a <code>Just value</code>. Not too onerous,
with Haskell’s syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>Speed. What is the one thing a developer values more than safety?
Performance! Lenses are written by some of the best Haskell authors
out there, and — for all the abstract foo-foo — this code flies
like lightning. It helps also that GHC is a cutting-edge speed devil
of a compiler, bar none.</p></li>
<li><p>Composability. Lenses are <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">nouns not verbs</a>, which means we can
name <code>firstUserBoard</code> and <code>firstUserBoardRating</code> like I did above,
and then use them in other lenses. Because they are nouns we can
give them names, which not only clarify our long pipeline by turning
code into documentation, but also allow us to pass them around to
other functions, if we so chose.</p></li>
<li><p>Faithfulness. Have you ever used a JSON library that encoded numbers
with IEEE floats? I have, and while it is rare to want the
arbitrary-precision numbers guaranteed by the spec, when you <em>do</em>
want it you <em>really</em> do want it. Lenses provides <code>_Number</code> as the
faithful representation of a JSON number, and <code>_Double</code> for when you
just want to do some quick math fast.</p>

<p>We can even write more complicated lenses that venture outside the
spec, like <code>_Date</code>. It would be quite easy and short.</p>

<p>Types matter. Most bugs in Trello trace back to our using strings,
a one-dimensional list of characters, instead of The Right Thing™.
Computers may not, but humans need more dimensions.</p>

<p>We joke a lot that it would be a full-time position, and quite
satisfying at that, to simply dictate the type signatures in our
code. Call it a Type Czar, whose job is to reject pull requests
that added functions with types too dumb.</p></li>
<li><p>Unification of getters and setters. There is a Berlin Wall in
programming, and it’s between getters and setters. The idea that you
have to write this boilerplate over and over again is outdated in
2015:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"> public String foo {
   get { return this._foo; }
   set { this._foo = value; }
 }
</code></pre></div>
<p>Why did I have to write the <code>this._foo</code> twice? Why
is <code>value</code> a special keyword I have to use; why is it not a
function parameter? Why do we have properties when we have methods
already? Don’t even get me started on <code>@synthesize foo =
_foo;</code> in Apple C.</p>

<p>These annoyances add up. I feel old. I feel <em>old</em>. I am
weary of object-oriented programming, for boilerplate like this. For
having to tell my IDE to generate code for me. The ghosts of
functional programming — of LISP and of macros and of
code-as-data-as-code — reach out to me, to taunt me; and rightly so.
And I do not know what I have become.</p>

<p>With lenses, a getter and a setter is one value, and it’s a value
familiar to any functional programmer: a function.
<code>firstUserBoard</code> is a function, as surprising as that may
seem. Functions compose. Functions are nouns. Functions are in my
lifeblood in a way that “properties” as defined by section
god-knows-what of god-knows-where in the official Microsoft Oracle
Design-By-Committee Corruption-Of-Smalltalk♮ spec.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The way I think about lenses is as pipelines, rushing data forwards
(pulling a smaller structure out of a larger one) and backwards
(updating a smaller structure inside a larger one, and being able to
wrap everything back up), connected at the joints by our function
composition operator <code>.</code>.</p>

<p>Lenses make me excited about programming again.</p>

<h2>Lenses are imperfect</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Studying the structure of lenses requires rank-<em>n</em> polymorphism and
existentially-qualified typeclasses. Can we build a type system one
day where lenses feel natural, that better encodes the nature of
lenses' twisty function-lifting than arrows can? I do not know. I
would dedicate the rest of my life to doing so, if I knew how.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result, the type inferencing for lenses is weak at times. You
will get alerts about <code>Monoid</code>s when you really just need to use
<code>^?</code> instead of <code>^.</code>. The reason is fascinating, but nobody should
need to research the math of an error in order to understand the error.</p></li>
<li><p>Lenses use cute names and operators because there were no names for
the ideas lenses put forth. All words are made up, as the old joke
goes. Hopefully one day we will all share a vocabulary for these
beautiful visitors from outer space. But until then, vocabulary is
part of the learning curve.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>But and so</h2>

<p>History will look back kindly on lenses, even if it remains
underground and punk rock like it is today.</p>

<p>If you want to play with the code in this <em>Computer Club</em> clubbing,
please do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">#!/bin/sh
set -eu
mkdir /tmp/lens-sandbox
cd !$
cabal sandbox init
cabal install lens lens-aeson -j
cabal repl
</code></pre></div>
