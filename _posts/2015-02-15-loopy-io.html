<h2>Dilemma</h2>

<p>Dilemma: you are a lazy, pure, typed functional language and you want
to be able to read standard input.</p>

<p>In an impure language, like C, this isn’t a big deal. Those languages
have a <code>read</code> that look like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">// Reads up to newline from standard input, and returns it as a string.</span>
<span class="c1">// (You'll have to free the string manually, I guess.)</span>
<span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>(void)</code> is our way of telling the compiler that <code>read</code> takes no
arguments. Which means <code>read</code> starts with nothing!</p>

<p>Nothing but the C environment, that is, which includes all sorts of
useful things: global variables, system calls, <code>malloc(3)</code>, <code>free(3)</code>,
<code>rand(3)</code>, all of libc, and so on.</p>

<p>In you — a pure language — a function that takes no arguments
starts with <em>nothing</em>. And this time we mean actually nothing. A pure
language cannot, by definition, create side effects. Off limits are
global variables and system calls and all of libc.</p>

<p>You probably find this highly restrictive. But purity is not simply a
tax: it gives us equational reasoning, and a faster compiler, and
stronger types.</p>

<p>So, anyway, whatever: unless we are more clever, there is only one way
to implement <code>read</code> with this type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="c1">-- Reads up to newilne from standard input, and returns it as a string.</span>
<span class="nf">read</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Bytes</span>
<span class="nf">read</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">utf8Encode</span> <span class="s">"hello, world"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>(I am assuming some familiarity with ML/Haskell-like syntax here. I am
often uncertain of the amount of explaining that goes into a good
post. Every dispatch from the frontier seems to require two other
dispatches.)</p>

<p>We can vary the string, but it always has to be a constant. And so we
abandon the idea of pure I/O.…</p>

<p>… or we can be more clever.</p>

<h2>Being more clever</h2>

<p>We said earlier that you lack an “environment,” for some definition of
that word, in <code>read</code> and also every other function, and we ascribed
this handcuff to purity. This is not quite true.</p>

<p>There is exactly <em>one</em> place where you do have an environment. In C,
it is <em>everywhere</em>: you can call <code>malloc(3)</code> from anywhere and the C
runtime knows exactly what you mean. But, for you, you only have
<em>one</em>.</p>

<p>And that place is your <code>main</code> function.</p>

<p>In C we are used to <code>main</code> functions that are very dumb.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">// Please return an exit code.</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You might think that you have to do the same thing in your language,
and ask executable programs to implement an entry point with the same
type.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Int</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">undefined</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But why? Without the baggage of C’s <code>int main(void)</code> we might
adventure onward and explore more interesting types.</p>

<p>For example, what if <code>main</code> could ask the runtime to do something?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Request</span> <span class="ow">=</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdIn</span>

<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Request</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdIn</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Cute, and pure. But you’ll notice immediately a big problem: <code>main</code>
can ask questions, but it can never hear answers. You might at this
point try:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="nf">submitRequest</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Request</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bytes</span>
<span class="nf">submitRequest</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">undefined</span>

<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Int</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">submitRequest</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdin</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But you’ll end up with the same problem as before: there is no way to
implement <code>Request -&gt; Bytes</code> in a pure language, besides all the
trivial useless ways.</p>

<p>You might then ask: can we send the bytes to <code>main</code> directly? We did
make a big fuss about <code>main</code> having some sort of “environment.” And
the answer is yes!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Request</span> <span class="ow">=</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdin</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Exit</span> <span class="kt">Int</span>

<span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Event</span> <span class="ow">=</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">ProgramJustStarted</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdinComplete</span> <span class="kt">Bytes</span>

<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Event</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Request</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="kt">ProgramJustStarted</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdin</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">ReadStdinComplete</span> <span class="n">bytes</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Exit</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You now have I/O in a completely pure way. And they said it couldn’t
be done.</p>

<h2>Troubling rumors from the edge of civilization</h2>

<p>An astute reader might criticize your library design on the point that
it seems impossible to read from stdin more than once. (After all, how
would you distinguish between different reads?)</p>

<p>As a computer scientist, you solve problems by either caching,
counting, or naming. In this case, counting seems best:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Event</span> <span class="ow">=</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">ProgramJustStarted</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdinComplete</span> <span class="kt">Int</span> <span class="kt">Bytes</span>

<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Event</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">Request</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="kt">ProgramJustStarted</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdin</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">ReadStdinComplete</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">bytes</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdin</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">ReadStdinComplete</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">bytes</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Exit</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Ah, thinks the astute reader. She has implemented allowed me to read
<code>bytes</code> and so I have two <code>bytes</code> variables but I could never use
both.</p>

<p>This problem is <em>very interesting</em>. The problem of sequencing and
interleaving computation is something on which you could spend an
entire novel; you could lead an entire seminar on the problem, and how
humans have tackled it. Generals have led soldiers to battle on much
simpler problems. The problem transcends both creation/art and
death/war.</p>

<p>But there’s something simple at hand that you can reach for, which is
lists.</p>

<h2>Lists?</h2>

<p>You and I, we have been using <code>[a]</code> very innocently so far, to
represent a list of values of type <code>a</code>. But we are a <em>lazy</em> language.
And in a <em>lazy</em> language, lists are actually much closer to <em>streams</em>.</p>

<p>In a <em>lazy</em> language, all the values in a list may not be determined
at the time the list is passed into a function. So you could have this
program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Event</span> <span class="ow">=</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">ProgramJustStarted</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdinComplete</span> <span class="kt">Int</span> <span class="kt">Bytes</span>

<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">Event</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">Request</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">ProgramJustStarted</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdinComplete</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdinComplete</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ow">=</span>
  <span class="p">[</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdin</span>
  <span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">ReadStdin</span>
  <span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Exit</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
  <span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And here’s how you could run such a program, if you were the runtime
(and the metaphorical conceit of this post is that you are, so just go
with it):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pass <code>(ProgramJustStarted : thunk) :: [Event]</code> to this program’s <code>main</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the <code>head</code> of <code>main</code>’s list of requests.</p></li>
<li><p>If the request is <code>Exit Int</code>, exit with that exit code.</p></li>
<li><p>Else if the request is <code>ReadStdin</code>, make a system call to read <code>bytes</code> from your local friendly POSIX-compliant operating system. Then expand thunk out by one step: <code>(ProgramJustStarted : ReadStdinComplete bytes) :: Event</code>. Then repeat.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The key here is that the list is <em>eventually</em> all three events.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>We cautiously venture that this might actually work.</p>

<h2>It does</h2>

<p>It does! This is, at its core, the design of I/O library in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/history.pdf">Haskell 1.0 Report (see section 7 and figure 3 of this <em>impossibly</em> well-written and interesting, “you should read the entire thing and not just section 7”-type paper)</a>.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
  Haskell has since wildly improved upon this design, but that is a post for another day.
</p>

<p>Let’s round out this longwinded weblog post with something useful: a
program that reads two integers from standard input and prints the sum
to standard out.</p>

<p>It may seem to you strange that we are able to define a list of requests whose values depend on the list of events whose values depend on said list of requests whose values depend on….</p>

<p>Why is that possible? And how is possible in such few lines of code?</p>

<p>Perhaps we should stop teaching C and Java as first languages.</p>

<p>In any case, this is as good a stopping point as any. Next time let’s
talk about continuations and, after that, monads.</p>

<p>Haskell users might point out here that this requires lazy
pattern-matching, whereas Haskell defaults to strict, so at this point
the weblog post begins to deviate from Haskell. And but so <em>Is this
really Haskell I/O?</em>. To which we say, take it down a
notch.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>Haskell jumps into lazy pattern matching if you prepend a tilde to
your patterns. We have simply elided the tildes here.</p>

entire post. As an understatement: Simon Peyton-Jones is a good
writer. His being one of the architects of Haskell and GHC is just
icing.</p>

<p>But: if you want to translate the code from this post into code
from the paper, let me help you a little:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In Haskell and in the paper, tildes start lazy pattern matching,
but prevent the nice square-bracket syntax we’ve been using.</p></li>
<li><p>The paper is doing the correct thing ending with an underscoer
e.g. <code>x : y : _</code>, which allows more events than we were
expecting. Our program would simply crash if more events were
sent than we expected.</p></li>
<li><p>spj has aliased <code>Behaviour</code> to <code>[Response] -&gt; [Request]</code>,
which is equivalent to our <code>[Event] -&gt; [Request]</code>. Thus
<code>main :: Behaviour</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ProgramHasStarted</code> is actually <code>Success</code>.</p></li>
