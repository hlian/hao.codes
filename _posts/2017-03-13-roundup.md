[streaming](https://github.com/michaelt/streaming) is a Haskell package with a manifesto. The author presents a strong argument for modeling streaming as a compiler-friendly version of `FreeT`, the free-monad transformer.

Somewhat of a golden age of profunctors is happening among Haskell weblogs. We have ["Profunctors, Arrows, & Static Analysis"](http://elvishjerricco.github.io/2017/03/10/profunctors-arrows-and-static-analysis.html), ["Monoids on Steroids"](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2017/02/09/monoids-on-steroids/), and ["Addressing Pieces of State with Profunctors"](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2017/01/addressing-pieces-of-state-with.html).

Kmett's answer on ["Today, I used laziness for..."](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5xge0v/today_i_used_laziness_for/) reaches some sort of ecstatic plane for /r/haskell commenting and leads the reader down a rabbit hole of "close the circle"-type lazy programming. See also: ["Water collected between towers"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24414700/water-collected-between-towers) and [the solution with `Control.Monad.Tardis`](https://gist.github.com/paf31/9d84ecf6a6a9b69cdb597a390f25764d). h/t doug

["An algebra of graphs"](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/an-algebra-of-graphs/) is now an [ICFP paper](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/an-algebra-of-graphs/)!

["A case of reflection"](http://newartisans.com/2017/02/a-case-of-reflection/) is a tutorial on introducing runtime information through compiletime superclass constraints with the all-star `reflection` package.

[Join points have landed in GHC 8](https://perf.haskell.org/ghc/#revision/8d5cf8bf584fd4849917c29d82dcf46ee75dd035), leading to impressive gains in allocation benchmarks. For more information, see [SPJ's talk on demystifying GHC Core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_VzYxvbxg) at around minute 50 or read ["Compiling without continuations"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/compiling-without-continuations.pdf).

["Derivable Type Classes"](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/430960/derive.pdf) is an old Hinze and SPJ paper that proposes a what-if for generic programming that never came to be:

```haskell
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  
  (==){1} Unit Unit = True
  (==){a + b} (Inl x) (Inl y) = x == y
  (==){a + b} (Inr x) (Inr y) = x == y
  (==){a + b} _ = False
  (==){a * b} (x :*: y) (z :*: w) = x == z && y == w
```

[sheyll/type-spec](https://github.com/sheyll/type-spec) is an insane type-level test framework.
