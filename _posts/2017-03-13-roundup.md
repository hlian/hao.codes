[streaming](https://github.com/michaelt/streaming) is a Haskell package with a manifesto. The author presents a strong argument for modeling streaming as a compiler-friendly version of `FreeT`, the free-monad transformer.

Somewhat of a golden age of profunctors is happening among Haskell weblogs. We have ["Profunctors, Arrows, & Static Analysis"](http://elvishjerricco.github.io/2017/03/10/profunctors-arrows-and-static-analysis.html), ["Monoids on Steroids"](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2017/02/09/monoids-on-steroids/), and ["Addressing Pieces of State with Profunctors"](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2017/01/addressing-pieces-of-state-with.html).

Kmett's answer on ["Today, I used laziness for..."](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5xge0v/today_i_used_laziness_for/) reaches some sort of ecstatic plane for /r/haskell commenting and leads the reader down a rabbit hole of "close the circle"-type lazy programming. See also: ["Water collected between towers"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24414700/water-collected-between-towers) and [the solution with `Control.Monad.Tardis`](https://gist.github.com/paf31/9d84ecf6a6a9b69cdb597a390f25764d). h/t doug

["An algebra of graphs"](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/an-algebra-of-graphs/) is now an [ICFP paper](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/an-algebra-of-graphs/)!

["A case of reflection"](http://newartisans.com/2017/02/a-case-of-reflection/) is a tutorial on introducing runtime information through compiletime superclass constraints with the all-star `reflection` package.
