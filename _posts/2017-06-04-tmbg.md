Perpetually under construction so don't even get me started.

Vying for first place in the competition among _Spoke Proof_ blog posts to be the most self-indulgent claptrap ever assembled into HTML.

## What is TMBG?

_They Might Be Giants_ is a force of rock and roll that has been around since the late 1980s. Their music is eclectic and then some. They sound like the music that would play over the PA in your dream of circus. Their catalog is _huge_. Unsubstantiated opinion, given with the energy of a drunk bar patron who's trying to pick a fight: You should listen to them in chronological order.

## Favorite Lyrics

_My armchair theory is that a person's soul can be triangulated by their three most favorite They Might Be Giants lyrics. With their range and their corpus of words you should be able to express any interesting truth about the universe._

_That being said, these lyrics are listed in an arbitrary order._

## Favorite Facts About TMBG

John Linnell used to be a bike messenger and he would bike around NYC all day singing songs he made up to himself

The number one rule of the TMBG fan club is to unequivocally deny that you are a member if ever asked and to instead pretend that you have no knowledge of the existence of any fan club

One day TMBG will stop producing new music and there will be nobody else left to catch whatever odd bursts of inspiration from the cosmic depths that TMBG is alone able to intercept
